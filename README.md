# Hulabear Downloader
Download atricles from telnet://hulabear.twbbs.org

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Python 2.7

### Usage

```
python run.py -a [hula account] -p [hula password] -b [board] -s [starting article number] -e [ending article number]
```

For example, if you want to download No.2 ~ No.5 articles in board Cs11 (note that the board name is case-sensitive):
```
python run.py -a account -p password -b Cs11 -s 2 -e 5
```
Or if you only want to download article No.30:
```
python run.py -a account -p password -b Cs11 -s 30 -e 30
```

### Download Folder

A Folder `download_[board]` will be automatically created under the root folder.

For example, if you download articles from Cs11, the articles will be in:
```
hulabear_downloader\download_Cs11
```

### Config

In config.ini, there are some configs you can try:
```
[host]
timeout = 6

[data]
page_splitter =

[encode]
file_name = big5 | utf8

```
- If your connection to hulabear is too slow, you can increase the `timeout` limit.
- If you want to know the range of a page within an article, you can change `page_splitter` to `--`
- The file name can be encoded to either big5 or utf-8.

## Features
* Save each article as a single text file.
* Remove BBS color code.
* Auto-skiping board opening page.
* Skip inaccessible F(friend only) or L(locked) articles.
* Delete duplicated account login.

## Known Issues
Waiting for your pull request to fix these issues :)
* Do not support most of the BBS control code.
* Lines hit the end of the page will appear twice.
  (because hulabear copies the ending line of a page to the next page as a begining line)
* Unexpected spaces in article (due to BBS control code).
